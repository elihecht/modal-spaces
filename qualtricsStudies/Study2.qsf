Harming someone on purpose is generally worse than harming someone by accident, or even harming someone in a way that is foreseen but not intended.<\/span><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align:top\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align:top\"><strong>Main questions and hypotheses:<\/strong><\/span><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"vertical-align:top\">A fundamental goal of our research is to understand the cognitive and emotional factors that influence social judgment and decision-making.
